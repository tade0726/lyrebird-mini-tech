SITUATION (Chief Complaint & HPI):
- Chief complaint: "Escalating shortness of breath, pleuritic chest discomfort, and fatigue over the past week."
- HPI: A 43-year-old female experiencing increasing shortness of breath over the past week, with pleuritic chest discomfort and fatigue. Reports difficulty climbing stairs, nocturnal coughing, and orthopnea requiring three pillows.

OBJECTIVE FINDINGS:
- **Vital Signs:** SpO₂ 89% on room air.
- **Physical Exam:** 
  - Respirations: Labored
  - Auscultation: Bilateral basal crackles audible
- **Diagnostics Ordered / Results:** 
  - Chest radiograph: Interstitial infiltrates consistent with acute decompensated heart failure.
  - Laboratory studies: Elevated BNP, impaired renal function.
  - Blood cultures drawn
  - Urgent echocardiogram ordered to assess ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Acute decompensated heart failure
2. Suspected infectious exacerbation — pending blood culture results
3. Renal impairment

PLAN:
- **Diagnostics:** 
  - Echocardiogram urgent
  - Blood cultures collected
- **Therapeutics / Medication Changes:**
  - Initiated high-flow oxygen
  - Administered 40 mg intravenous furosemide
  - Started low-dose nitroglycerin infusion
- **Disposition & Follow‑up:**
  - Admit to monitored cardiac step-down unit
  - Aggressive diuresis, telemetry, and electrolyte surveillance
- **Patient Education / Safety‑netting:**
  - Family informed and consent obtained for potential transfer to intensive care.

RESULT / OUTCOME:
- Decisions: Started treatment and admission for monitoring and intervention.
- Goals: Improve respiratory function and stabilize cardiac status.
- Scheduled follow-up: Monitored in the cardiac step-down unit, potential escalation to ICU if necessary.

NOTES:
- This medical note provides a structured summary based on the initial examination and immediate management steps.
