- Patient Name: [Name]
- Provider: [Clinician\'s name & credential]
- Date: [Not documented]

MEDICATIONS ADMINISTERED:
- High-flow oxygen therapy
- Furosemide 40mg IV bolus
- NTG infusion (low-dose)

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:
CC: Acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fatigue

HPI: 43-year-old female presenting with progressive dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue x 1 week. Associated symptoms include stair-climbing limitation, nocturnal cough, and orthopnea requiring triple-pillow elevation.

OBJECTIVE DATA:
- VS: Oxygen saturation 89% (room air)
- Exam: Tachypnea with increased work of breathing; bilateral basilar rales
- Diagnostics: 
  * Imaging: CXR demonstrates bilateral interstitial opacities c/w pulmonary edema
  * Laboratory: â†‘BNP, reduced GFR

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary congestion
2. Acute kidney injury (likely cardiorenal syndrome)
3. Rule out infectious precipitant (cultures pending)

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT:
1. Diagnostic studies:
   - Blood cultures obtained
   - STAT echocardiogram to assess LV function

2. Therapeutic interventions:
   - Supplemental oxygen: High-flow device initiated
   - Diuresis: Furosemide 40mg IV administered
   - Preload/afterload reduction: NTG drip initiated

3. Disposition:
   - Admit to cardiac telemetry unit
   - Frequent electrolyte monitoring
   - ICU transfer protocol discussed and consent obtained

4. Communication:
   - Family informed of diagnosis and management plan

INTERIM STATUS:
Patient transferred to telemetry unit for intensive monitoring and management. Will reassess after initial diuresis and cardiac evaluation.', '2025-05-27 11:15:34.403267', '2025-05-27 11:15:34.403271', 'Patient is a 43-year-old female presenting today with escalating shortness of breath, pleuritic chest discomfort, and fatigue over the past week. She reports difficulty climbing a flight of stairs, nocturnal coughing, and orthopnea requiring three pillows. On examination, her respirations are labored, pulse oximetry reads 89% on room air, and bilateral basal crackles are audible. Chest radiograph confirms interstitial infiltrates consistent with acute decompensated heart failure. Laboratory studies reveal elevated BNP and impaired renal function. I have initiated high-flow oxygen, administered 40 milligrams intravenous furosemide, and started low-dose nitroglycerin infusion to reduce preload. We have drawn blood cultures to rule out infectious exacerbation and ordered an urgent echocardiogram to assess ejection fraction. The patient is being admitted to the monitored cardiac step-down unit for aggressive diuresis, telemetry, and electrolyte surveillance. Family has been briefed and consent obtained for potential transfer to intensive care.');
